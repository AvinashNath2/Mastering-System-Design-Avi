High-level design for a coupon redeeming microservice along with its Logical Level Design (LLD)

***Requirement***
It should provide functionalities for creating, validating, and redeeming coupons.


Coupon Entity:

Attributes:
ID (Unique identifier for the coupon)
Code (Alphanumeric code for the coupon)
Discount (Percentage or fixed amount discount)
Expiry Date
Redeemed (Boolean flag indicating whether the coupon has been redeemed or not)
Usage Limit (Maximum number of times the coupon can be redeemed)
Coupon Repository:

Responsible for persisting coupon entities. It can be implemented using a database like MySQL, MongoDB, etc.
Coupon Service:

Handles the business logic related to coupons.
Functionalities:
Generate Coupon: Generates a new coupon with a unique code and specified attributes.
Validate Coupon: Checks if a coupon is valid (not expired, not redeemed, etc.).
Redeem Coupon: Marks a coupon as redeemed if it's valid and has not exceeded the usage limit.
Coupon Controller:

Defines REST endpoints for interacting with coupons.
Endpoints:
POST /coupons/generate: Generates a new coupon.
GET /coupons/{couponId}/validate: Validates a coupon.
POST /coupons/{couponId}/redeem: Redeems a coupon.
Coupon Redemption History:

Optionally, you can keep track of coupon redemption history for analytics purposes.
Attributes:
Coupon ID
User ID
Redemption Date
Order ID (if the coupon was used in an order)
Coupon Redemption History Repository:

Persists coupon redemption history entities.






Database Schema:

Coupon Table:

Fields:
coupon_id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
code (Unique)
discount
expiry_date
redeemed (Boolean)
usage_limit
Redemption History Table:

Fields:
redemption_id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
coupon_id (Foreign Key referencing Coupon Table)
user_id
redemption_date
order_id (Nullable, if the coupon was used in an order)
Coupon Table:

Field	Type	Constraints
coupon_id	INT	Primary Key, Auto-inc
code	VARCHAR	Unique
discount	DECIMAL	
expiry_date	DATETIME	
redeemed	BOOLEAN	
usage_limit	INT	
Redemption History Table:

Field	Type	Constraints
redemption_id	INT	Primary Key, Auto-inc
coupon_id	INT	Foreign Key (Coupon)
user_id	INT	
redemption_date	DATETIME	
order_id	INT	Nullable
This schema allows for efficient storage and retrieval of coupon data as well as redemption history. The coupon_id in the Redemption History table is a foreign key referencing the primary key coupon_id in the Coupon table, establishing a relationship between the two tables. This enables tracking of coupon redemptions and associating them with specific coupons.






Handling the scenario where only one coupon is left for redemption and multiple user requests for redemption simultaneously is crucial to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions. Here's how you can handle this situation:

Atomic Check and Update:
Implement a mechanism that ensures atomicity when checking and updating the coupon's redemption status. This can be achieved through transactions in relational databases or using atomic operations in NoSQL databases.

Concurrency Control:
Utilize concurrency control mechanisms to handle concurrent requests. For example, you can use locks or optimistic concurrency control techniques to prevent multiple users from redeeming the same coupon simultaneously.

Check Availability Before Redemption:
Before allowing a redemption attempt, check the availability of the coupon. If only one coupon is left and multiple requests are received, deny redemption for all but one of the requests.

Queueing or Rate Limiting:
Implement a queueing system or rate-limiting mechanism to process redemption requests in a controlled manner. This ensures that only one request is processed at a time when there's only one coupon left.

Error Handling and Response:
Provide appropriate error messages or responses to users whose redemption requests cannot be fulfilled due to the unavailability of coupons. Inform users that the coupon has already been redeemed or is no longer available.

Monitoring and Alerting:
Monitor the redemption process and set up alerts for situations where the number of available coupons is critically low. This allows administrators to take proactive measures, such as generating more coupons or investigating potential issues.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively handle the scenario where only one coupon is left for redemption and multiple users attempt to redeem it simultaneously while ensuring data consistency and preventing conflicts.
